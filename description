PROJECT TITLE : CORONA INFORMATION RECORD SYSTEM

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT:
	The objective of this project is to provide the user ,a user-friendly atmosphere where he can upload , get details of corona affected patients in various stages in different districts of various states and also apply for e-pass.

	This project provides a visual comparison by means of  bar graph between different districts in a state and between different states in a country

	This project provides the status of ventilators availability in different states and gives an alarm if there is any scarcity in a particular state 

	This project also attempts to provide e-pass from district to district by verifying whether the percentage of affected patients in all the levels in both the destination and native districts is less than 25%

	It also provides a list of applicants those who had applied for e-pass
